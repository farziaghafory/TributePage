<p>One weekend when I was in the fourth grade and my friend Whitney was coming to sleep over, my mother took me to the video store to rent a movie. I picked “A Nightmare on Elm Street” — Mom must not have checked the title or she would have balked — and I loved every second of it. Whitney, on the other hand, didn’t sleep well for weeks.

     That evening sparked my lifetime love of horror stories. I became the girl who made all her friends watch scary movies at slumber parties. (If you were one of them: I’m sorry.) Stephen King’s “It” remains one of my favorite books. I listen to disturbing true crime podcasts on my daily walks.
